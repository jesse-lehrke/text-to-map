# Text-to-map

 This code was written in part, and as part of some larger work, sometime in 2023 or thereabouts. It is currently (as of 29 Oct 2024) being cleaned, organized, and expanded for more general public use

 This notebook (soon to be split and expanded into several) takes a dataframe and using pos tags extracts placenames, gets coordinates for these, and places them on maps.

 Example use case: collecting news articles, extracting place names, and mapping them to see which cities are talked about in the news.

 Currently a couple category variables are also included and will be expanded upon, to map another feature than just locations (and count of times location mentioned).
